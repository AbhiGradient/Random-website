🚗 Random-Website

This is a frontend-only eCommerce practice project showcasing car modification parts.  
It was created as my first beginner project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The main goal was to understand how real-world websites are structured, how multiple pages are linked, and how basic styling and interactivity work.  

⚠️ Since this was my first project, there will be flaws — but that’s part of the learning journey!
